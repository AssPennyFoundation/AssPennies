WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
===================

Compilers Supported
-------------------
Release was compiled on a Windows XP VM using MinGW and EasyWinBuilder. Details here:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=252931.0
https://github.com/phelixbtc/bitcoin/tree/0.8.5-EWB

Phelix is a hero and has earned an honorary lifetime membership to The AssPenny Foundation for the work he did on this. After weeks of effort using various walkthroughs and forum threads, EasyWinBuilder got AssPennies up and running on Windows in a single day.

The only complication AssPenny developers experienced was needing w32api.h v3.13 for compiling Qt v4.8. Download the correct libaries from SourceForge and copy them into your MinGW installation folder: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/w32api-3.13-mingw32-dev.tar.gz
